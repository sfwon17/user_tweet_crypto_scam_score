# User_tweet_crypto_scam_score

This project involves analyzing tweet activity from specific users to assess their potential involvement in "pump and dump" schemes related to cryptocurrencies. It evaluates whether users are promoting and subsequently offloading tokens by examining tweet history, sentiment, and related metadata. In addition to analyzing token price trends to identify patterns consistent with pump-and-dump behavior, the project also considers overall market conditions for a more comprehensive assessment. The focus is on tokens with small market capitalizations (approximately $100 million). While it offers insights into potential market manipulation, it should not be used in isolation to definitively determine fraudulent behavior based solely on social media activity. This project was developed for personal use, with the primary objective of mitigating the risk of investing in tokens potentially manipulated by the observed users.
